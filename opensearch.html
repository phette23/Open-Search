<h1>Open Search</h1>
<p>...using Chesapeake College's Polaris OPAC as an example.</p>
<h1>JavaScript Test</h1>
<!-- notes:
	While the spec says the AddSearchProvider URL can be relative or absolute, Firefox appears to choke on relative URLs, saying "cannot install". Chrome also has trouble but fails totally silently.
	Google Chrome won't auto-suggest a keyword for your search, should research how to do that.
	Internet Explorer needs a .ico for the smaller image or it will use a generic spyglass icon to represent the search engine.
	The title attribute in the link[rel=search] doesn't become the name of the search engine when it's installed in the browser, rather the ShortName element in the Open Search XML does.
	Open Search specification (1.1): http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1

<p>If you <a href="#" onclick="window.external.AddSearchProvider('http://www.chesapeake.edu/library/open-search/opensearch.xml');return false;">click here</a>, a pop-up should prompt you to add the search engine to your browser.</p>
